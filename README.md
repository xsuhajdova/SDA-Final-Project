# SDA-Final-Project
Team final project from the Software Development Academy course focused on Software Testing.

For the final project, we tested the website https://petstore.octoperf.com/. We started by familiarizing ourselves with the test page and subsequently proposed several test cases. We used Chrome and Safari as a test environment.
We divided test cases into 5 basic parts: Registration and login, Menu and catalog, search functionality, Shopping cart/Ordering/Payment, Check Home Page behavior for returning customers.
Each of us focused on a different test case.
We recorded individual test cases in testrail. We executed the test cases and we set up the status per step (passed/failed). The bugs encountered were linked to the test cases and we established the severity for each one. 
To conclude the project we created a report which describes the entire project.
